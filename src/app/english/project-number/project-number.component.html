      This project is a little Python application where the user takes a
      picture, chose a section of the picture to analyse, processes it with
      OpenCV and find the numbers present using a convolutional neural network
      created using TensorFlow and trained on the MNIST dataset.

  <h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Motivation</h2>
  <section class="project-description">
    <p>
      This project was mostly created with the goal of learning. MNIST is
      everybody's first dataset when learning about machine learning with
      images. It is great to teach about standard ML methods, general neural
      network as well as CNN. It is also great to learn about data augmentation
      and the different techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, you can augment data by moving it around, rotating it, or
      even mirroring it. In the context of numbers however, you have to be
      careful since a mirrored number doesn't make sense and that some numbers
      when rotated 180 degrees can completely change.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also wanted to try an apply ML to an actual application. Making just a
      good classifier is one part of the problem but integrating it to an
      application is different. Here I use OpenCV to pre-process the image so I
      can use my CNN to clasify the numbers.

  <h2 class="sectionsubtitle">How it works</h2>
  <section class="project-description">
    <p>
      When first opening the app, the user is greeted with the main window. Make
      sure to plug in the webcam before starting the app. Also, if only one
      webcam is connected to the computer (including a laptop webcam), you might
      have to go change the value of the webcam index in the python file
      (self.videoCam = cv2.VideoCapture(1)).

      alt="Image of the app after first launching it."
      class="project-image slide-from-left"
    />
    <p>
      To take a picture, click on the "Take Picture" button. You can press it as
      many time as you want, it will simply overwrite the image.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then click and drag on the picture to select the area around which the
      numbers are.

      class="project-image slide-from-left"
    />
    <p>
      Then click on the "Process Image" to clean up the background and convert
      the image to binary. After that click on the "Classify!" button to
      classify the numbers. You can play with the number in the number box to
      optimize the output.

      While this app works, it was mostly a project to tinker around with ML and
      Python. It is far from optimized and some of the display and results may
      vary a lot depending on the quality of the webcam and lighting. But it was
      a very good and fun project to learn how to integrate ML into a project
      and how to build UIs with Qt.

        I used the Python version of OpenCV to do the segmentation part of the
        process before doing the actual classification.

        I used TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the model. It is a very
        basic CNN and I used a few data augmentation techniques to make it more
        robust for real world applications.
